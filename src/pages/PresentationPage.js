                My name is Madde Lundstr√∂m, and I am a software development student

                Throughout my academic journey, I have been fascinated by the intersection 
                of art and technology and how it can be used to create innovative and visually 
                appealing products. <br/> 
                I have also taken a keen interest in spirituality, psychology, 
                and mental health, which have taught me valuable lessons about mindfulness, empathy, 
                and emotional intelligence.

                <br />
                <p>
                As a team player, I love collaborating with others to create meaningful projects 
                that solve real-world problems. <br/>
                I value diverse perspectives and am always eager to learn from my peers. 
                <br/>At the same time, I also appreciate working independently 
                and can focus on coding tasks with music blaring through my headphones.

                In addition to my technical skills, I am fluent in English, Swedish, and Norwegian, <br/>
                which allows me to communicate effectively with people from different cultures and backgrounds. <br/>
                I believe that having a multicultural perspective is essential in today's globalized world.
